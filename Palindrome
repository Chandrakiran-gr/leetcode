Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer.
An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

For example, 121 is a palindrome while 123 is not.
 Example 1:

Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
Example 2:

Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
 
Constraints:
-231 <= x <= 231 - 1

SOLUTION :- 
class Solution {
public:
    int reverseDigit(int x)
    {
        long rev_num=0;
        while(x>0)
        {
           rev_num=(rev_num*10)+ x%10;
            x= x/10;
        }
        return rev_num;
    }
    bool isPalindrome(int x) {
         int rev_n=reverseDigit(x);
        if(rev_n==x)
            return true;
        else
            return false;
    }
};
